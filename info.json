"description":"We want to push forward medical research and get patients paid. Health X Change is a novel platform that incentivizes patients to share their health data by providing our ERC-20 token as compensation (Note: this token has not yet been launched). Health X Change plans to collect a unique set of health data that
pharma will preferentially purchase due to its scale and ability to centralize distinct data sources. As Health X Change strikes commercial and R&D partnerships with pharma companies, a portion of generated revenues will be used to provide value back to our tokenholders.",
